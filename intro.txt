Git:It is a tool that helps to track changes, and manage your code bases.

Github:Cloud based repository keeper.Also service like contribution,version controls, and others.


2 Github architecture:
 working directory:where your code are live.If you make any changes in this part then 
 it does not gets added to github.

 staging area:A middle ground where you prepare your codes for chnages.

 commit:Parmanent record of the project

working directory->staging area->commit(save the code).

example:
  A->added changes->store these changes as permanent changes.

  local code(local storage)->github


3 Git setup:
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

4 Basic git operations: 

   i) git init: Intialize a repo with git.
   ii)git status: Show all the changes in the working directory.
   iii)git add . :Stage all the modified changes.
   iv) git commit -m "message" : create a new commit with a message given to it.
   v) git push: add the chnages from staging to github.
   vi) git push -u main: sets the main branch upstream for code push.

5 Branches:
      D1
  A  
      D2

      same file-two developers- two different changes
      f1-D1,D2 made changes.


      b1: f1: D1 functionality for login-D1

      b2: f1: D2 functionality for login-D2

      b1 branch +D1 has added new file F2.
      b2 branch will not have file f2.  

      i) creating branch through github:
         git fetch origin: to pull all new created branches from github.
         git checkout <branchname>: to switch between branches.
      
      ii) Creating branches through local system and pushing to github.
          git branch <branch-name>: to create a branch locally.
          git push --all origin: to push the newly created branch from the local system to github.

6 Pull request:
   branch A(code 1)->pull request   branch B(code 2)

   pulling code from branch A to branch B.

   creating a pull request
   adding comments to pull request
   closing a pull request
   merging a pull request.

7 Forking: repo A(not a owner)
   To create a local copy(not on your system but on your github) of the repo.


   # Add the original repo as 'upstream'
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
    
    # Fetch latest changes from upstream
    git fetch upstream
    
    # Merge upstream/main into your local main
    git merge upstream/main
    
    # OR if you want a faster update (optional safer method)
    # git pull upstream main

8 Clone:creating a copy of the repo on your own local system.
   git clone <repo_https_link>
